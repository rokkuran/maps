# Maps
Simple script to plot world map of countries visited for two people. Cities and flights can also be incorporated.

Colours represent countries visited by two different people, red and blue. Each colour has alpha of 0.5, hence jointly visited countries are purple.


## Basic
![plot](https://github.com/rokkuran/maps/blob/master/output/plot.png)


## Incorporating cities and flights
Cities are green dots and flights are magenta curves.

## Future work
- Store google api city locations to local file.
