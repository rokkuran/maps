# Maps
Plot world map of countries visited. Cities and flights can also be incorporated.

Colours represent countries visited by two different people, red and blue. Each colour has alpha of 0.5, hence jointly visited countries are purple.


## Basic
![plot](https://github.com/rokkuran/maps/blob/master/output/plot.png)


## With cities and flights
![plot_with_cities_and_curve](https://github.com/rokkuran/maps/blob/master/output/plot_with_cities_and_curve.png)


## Future work
- Store google api city locations to local file.
